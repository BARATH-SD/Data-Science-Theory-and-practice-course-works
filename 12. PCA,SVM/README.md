Q.1 Support Vector Machine:

Data and other details are available at 

https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html

Use the weblink and reproduce the result for SVM.

Implement SVM to classify the type of iris flower based on its sepal length and width using the iris dataset? 
Also try to use the scikit-learn digits dataset and an SVM to classify handwritten digits? 
For both datasets, provide a step-by-step code, including:  

Loading the dataset 
Visualizing the data 
Splitting the data into training and testing sets 
Initializing and training the SVM model 
Testing the model 

Q. 2 Principal Component Analysis:

To do PCA, use the Eigen decomposition available in numpy. The dataset can be obtained from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_pca_3d.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-decomposition-plot-pca-3d-py. 
DO NOT USE the code available for PCA in the same link (as mentioned above, use numpy's Eigen decomposition). 
Compare your results with the one available in the link (here, you are free to use the code available in the link to generate any numbers for comparison). 
Are you getting the same result?
