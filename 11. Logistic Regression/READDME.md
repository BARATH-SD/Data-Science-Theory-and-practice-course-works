PART 1

1) (a ) Plot the sigmoid function. Print your interpretation on why this function is useful for a classification problem.

    (b) Plot the log functions in the cost function individually. Print your interpretation of the log functions

     c) Using your own data for a single feature problem, and assuming linear regression problem, plot the cost function and the corresponding contours. Also, using cross entropy as the cost function, plot it as well as its contours.

PART 2
 Logistic regression. Using the data provided (Logistic_regression_ls.csv), plot the decision boundary (linear) using Optimization of the sigmoid function.
