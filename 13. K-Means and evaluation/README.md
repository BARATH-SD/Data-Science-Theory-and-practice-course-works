PART 1

1) Create the following data and write to a csv file: Generate 10 random points in each of the the following circles (i) centre at (3,3) and radius 2, (ii) centre at (7,7) and radius 2 (iii) centre at (11,11) and radius 2.  Plot the data as well.                

2)  Implement K - means clustering algorithm (with out using sklearn library) and for the above data, show the change in the centroid as well as the class assignments. Also, plot the cost function for K varying from 1 to 5. Show that the value of K matches with the intuition from the data. Plot the K-classes for the final K-value.  
PART 2
3) Taking any two classes from the above data, add labels to them (0 or 1) and create a new csv file. Split the data into Train / Test set as 70/30. (a) Plot the decision boundary using the developed logistic regression code (either with or without regularization) from one of your previous labs. (b) Evaluate the metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score and Accuracy on the test data without using any library.
