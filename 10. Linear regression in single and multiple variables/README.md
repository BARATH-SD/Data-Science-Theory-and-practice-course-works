1) Implement the generalized equation for finding the gradient of m-samples, each having n-features. Also, implement the gradient descent approach assuming a constant learning rate.

2) Using the code developed for problem 1, do the linear regression for the univariate problem using the attached data file univariate_linear_regression.csv. Plot the cost function (both as surface as well as contour) as well as the best fit line. 

3) Using the code developed for problem 1, do the linear regression for the multivariate problem using the attached data file heart.data.csv. Plot the best fit plane for the given data. Can you also interpret the result (taking one independent variable at a time)?
