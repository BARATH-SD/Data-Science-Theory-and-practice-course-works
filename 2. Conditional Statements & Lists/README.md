Write a program to print numbers divisible by both 7 and 8. Numbers between 1 and 1000.

[Numbers like 56, which are both divisible by 7 and 8]

a. Using continue statement

b. Using the pass statement


2. Number 34567222541147 has been given. Print the addition of all even digits and the addition of all odd digits.

[Sample input = 156893, Sample Output: sum_even = 14 , sum_odd = 18]


3. Describe conditional expression. Write a program to print the maximum and minimum numbers from a list using conditional expression. Use the max () and min () functions to verify your output.


4. Pascalâ€™s  Triangle : Print the following pattern for the given N number of rows.

Sample Example:

Pattern for N = 8






5. A palindrome sentence is a phrase or sentence that reads the same forward as it does backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.


A) Take a number as input, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only integers. Eg: 2442


B) Now, take a string as an input and check whether it is Palindrome or not.  eg: "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"

The expected output for this example will print, 'True'



6. Describe chr () and ord () functions. Write a small program to show its functionality.Using these functions,write a program to print:

  A

  B B

  C C C

  D D D D

Example :Input list: ['Mark Antony', 'Mohan Raj'],

Output :

 a) ['Mark', 'Mohan']  

b) ['Antony', 'Raj'] 

c) ['Antony Mark', 'Raj Mohan']

d) ['Mark Antony', 'Mohan Raj']



8. WAP to find the minimum of 3 numbers using

 a) with conditional expressions. (No loops should be used)

 b) with nested conditional expression. (No loops should be used)

 c) similar to problem (b), find the minimum of 4 numbers.
