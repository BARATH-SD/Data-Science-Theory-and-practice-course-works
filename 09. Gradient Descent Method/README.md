1. For the question in last week's lab, is the search direction a gradient descent one? Comment on that.

2.Using steepest gradient descent, find all the local minima for the function  J(x1, x2) = (x1^2+x2−11)^2+(x1+x2^2−7)^2. While applying gradient descent, do the following (a) Fixing the value for alpha (b) use line search to determine the value for alpha. Plot the intermediate steps in the iteration to show one of the minimal point.
