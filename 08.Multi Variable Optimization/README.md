1 . For the function J(w) = w^2 + (54/w), implement the following methods: (a) Use the bracketed value (that you got in the last lab) to get to the critical point employing interval halving method and (b) identify the critical point using Newton-Raphson method and (c) verify the result manually using the optimality criteria (post this write-up as well in .jpg/.png etc).

2.  Plot the surface J(w1, w2) = (w1 - 10)^2 + (w2 - 10)^2. Also, generated the corresponding contour plot. Label the plots appropriately. Give a suitable title for the figure.

3. Using line (unidirectional) search, for the function (w1 - 10 )^2 + (w2 - 10)^2, find the minimum value along the direction (2, 5). You can assume the start point to be (2,1).  Plot the function and its contours along with the minimum value in that direction.
